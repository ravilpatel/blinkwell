# BlinkWell — Mindful Eye Care & Blink Wellness App

**Developed by:** Mitali Purohit  
**Package Name:** `com.mitalipurohit.blinkwell`  
**License:** Apache 2.0  

BlinkWell is a privacy-first, lightweight Android application that monitors your blink rate via the front camera while your device is in active use, alerts you via gentle notifications if blinking is abnormally low, and (only with explicit opt-in consent) syncs anonymized aggregate metrics to a researcher analytics dashboard.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- **100% On-Device Eye Analysis:** Raw camera frames/video are **never** stored, cached, or transmitted. Face and eye openness analysis is executed entirely on-device via Google ML Kit.
- **Background & App-Only Modes:**
  - **Background Mode:** Runs a camera foreground service with persistent notification and duty-cycled burst sampling to minimize battery drain. Halts immediately on screen-off.
  - **App-Only Mode:** Camera only runs while BlinkWell is actively open on screen (0% background CPU/battery footprint).
- **Offline First:** Room DB stores all session history locally. Core features require no account and no internet.
- **Multilingual:** Full support for **English** and **हिन्दी (Hindi)** with per-app language settings.
- **Built entirely via GitHub Actions:** No local Android Studio needed — CI automatically compiles and packages debug APKs and signed release bundles.

## 🚀 Building the App (GitHub Actions)

Since this project is configured to build without requiring a local Android Studio installation:

1. Push your code to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initialize BlinkWell"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Open the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
3. The **Android CI - Debug Build** workflow will compile the APK.
4. Download `blinkwell-debug-apk` from the workflow run's **Artifacts** section and install it directly on your Android phone.

## 📊 Supabase Setup (For Realtime Researcher Dashboard & Sync)

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard and paste the entire contents of [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql). Click **Run** to provision the tables, Realtime publication, and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.
3. In your GitHub repository settings, under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add the following Repository Secrets:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (or `SUPABASE_URL`) = `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (or `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) = `your-anon-public-key`
4. **Instant In-Browser Connection**: If visiting the live dashboard on GitHub Pages before a redeploy has occurred, click **"Configure Supabase"** on the login page or in the top navigation bar to input your Supabase URL & Anon Key directly.
